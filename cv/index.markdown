### 2009-2010
.Net Technical Leader & Project Manager at SGCIB (Fastconnect mission)


I'm working in a team developing security tools for other ITEC teams: ITEC/CSY/IT2/ISOTEAM.

I work on an ASP.Net 2.0 web portal to manage windows production servers remotely, with access control and traceability, with very strong security concern (configuration encryption, mutual certificate authentication) and some NT skills (WMI).

The project includes a Winform application with real-time status (using Comet principles and distributed cache using Gigaspaces).

I'm also working on a ActiveDirectory management Web interface, with automation of people account management depending of the workflow process (creation/activation/de-activation).

I started as the technical leader, defining the architecture with in-house ASP.Net 2.0 MVC framework based on Spring.net. I also trained the team about good practices with Jira, SVN and Unit testing. I set up the Continuous Integration with Hudson and MSBuild for several uses:



	
  * Build source code

	
  * Analyse source code (StyleCop/FxCop/Gendarme/SourceMonitor)

	
  * Unit Tests (with NUnit-NCover)

	
  * Integration Tests (DB)

	
  * UI automated tests with Selenium

	
  * Package a version, including the right configuration files

	
  * Automatic deploy on several servers


Then I'm now the project manager with 3 members in Paris and 3 members in Bangalore. I set up the SCRUM methodology to work in offshore context (2 weeks sprint), with success!

I use Jira with Greenhopper to do virtual Scrum dashboard, and Specflow to write User Stories in a BDD way.

I'm in charge of the management of the international team and of the client relationship.
This involves presentation of the tool, training, understanding the need, defining priority of backlog items, dispatching work between Paris and Bangalore, Scrum Master.


#### Technical Environment:


C# 3, ASP.Net 2.0, OO Javascript, JQuery, Winforms, Spring.net (IOC/AOP/etc.), Quartz.Net, NHibernate, NUnit, RhinoMocks, Speckflow, Selenium, WMI, ActiveDirectory, IIS 6, MSSQL 2008, Jira+Greenhopper, Confluence, SVN, Hudson, Sonar, MSBuild, Gigaspaces


### 2008-2009
.Net Technical Leader & Agile Consultant at Ineo Media System (Fastconnect mission)


My mission was to develop a new ASP.Net Web application to manage Windows machine remotely. It included also applying the Scrum (3 weeks Sprint) and TDD methodology and train people to adopt it. I installed and used tools like Redmine (then Jira) and I set up a Continuous Integration platform for .Net/Java with Hudson.

I did also some internal frameworks as a Winform/WebForm i18n library, and “ready to use” API to secure ASMX/WCF WebServices with Certificates.

I also did some Java development on EMC Documentum connectors for a “meta search engine”, using AXIS to connect to WebServices, and Zoom/JZKit API for Z3950 protocol.

I set up Hudson to test connectors automatically every day (non-regression tests with external WebServices).

I worked also on another ASP.Net project about a fully configurable web forms generator with customizable workflow, and I re-written it with ASP.Net MVC.


#### Technical environment:


VisualBasic, ASP.net 3.5, Javascript, C# 3, WCF, WSE 3.0, ASP.Net MVC, IIS 6/7, NUnit, RhinoMocks, Spring.net (IOC/AOP/etc.), Redmine, Jira, Hudson, Java, JUnit, Axis, Z3950, Documentum, PostgreSQL


### 2008 (3 months)

#### Technical environment:

### 2004-2007
Delphi/.Net Technical Leader at 20-20 Technologies


I was working on a windows application (CRM & Invoicing) for kitchen sellers of US and Canada: 20-20 BizManager ([http://www.2020technologies.com/Products/Kitchen-Bath/20-20_Bizmanager/20-20_BizManager/](http://www.2020technologies.com/Products/Kitchen-Bath/20-20_Bizmanager/20-20_BizManager/))

I started by fixing bugs of the existing code (almost 1 year). Then, I was the technical leader of the project, in charge of a migration from Delphi to C# .Net, with a strong experience about COM/Interop to integration new .Net modules into the exiting Delphi project. I was also in charge of the training of the team to .Net.
During the project, I developed some in-hous framework including a COM Middleware for Data interchange (between different Invoicing software), and a MVC Winforms framework based on Spring.net.

I set up the new development environment with SVN, Trac (for project planning/bug tracking and Wiki) and an automated build server to package and deliver the product to Canadian QA team using the tool AutomatedQA.

I trained 3 teams to use this new environment.

I had a good experience about working with an international team (Canada/US/Germany/Nederland), including regular english conf-call, writing english functional specifications, and jetlag or cultural differences.
